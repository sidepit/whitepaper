An exchange’s economic function is not simply to make the transactions but 
(and this is the bigger challenge) an exchange also “produces” the prices at which 
the transactions are made. Delivering quality price discovery is a defining function 
of a stock exchange. From a definitional perspective, any trading facility that has as 
its primary function the delivery of good price discovery can, de facto at least, be 
considered an exchange. Unfortunately, however, the price discovery function of an 
exchange typically receives insufficient attention in market structure discussions. 
This is largely attributable to the non-observability of equilibrium prices and, therefore, to the difficulty of quantifying the deviations of transaction prices from their 
equilibrium values



aving recognized (a) the importance of an exchange delivering reasonably accurate price discovery, (b) that the quality of price discovery can be assessed by an 
intraday volatility metric, and (c) that intraday, first half-hour volatility can be strikingly high, we have one further matter to address at this time: the relationship 
between the quality of price discovery and a market’s architecture.

There is a large and growing theoretical literature that considers the economic role
of limit orders in the price discovery process. Foucault (1993), Glosten (1989, 1994),
Easley and O’Hara (1991), Parlour (1998), Chakravarty and Holden (1995),
Kavajecz (1998), Rock (1996), Sandas (1999), and Seppi (1997) are just a few recent (
examples. The general focus of these papers is the effect of limit orders on the
market, the interaction between limit and market orders, and the role of the market
maker. None of these studies is set in a continuous-trading environment, hence they
provide little direct guidance for modeling limit-order execution times

Price discovery is one of the central functions of financial markets. In the market
microstructure literature, it has been variously interpreted as, “the search for an equilibrium price” (Schreiber and Schwartz (1986)), “gathering and interpreting news”
(Baillie et. al. (2002)), “the incorporation of the information implicit in investor
trading into market prices” (Lehmann (2002)). These interpretations suggest that
price discovery is dynamic in nature, and an efficient price discovery process is characterized by the fast adjustment of market prices from the old equilibrium to the
new equilibrium with the arrival of new information. In particular, Madhavan (2002)
distinguishes dynamic price discovery issues from static issues such as trading cost
determination


e. As a result, our methodology establishes
a framework to directly quantify the dynamics of price discover

4.1 Price Discovery
4.1.1 Importance of Price Discovery
Price discovery is achieved as orders are submitted to a market and turned into 
trades. A transaction price is, of course, determined each time a trade is consummated, but price discovery refers to something more fundamental. Price discovery
