abstract = {In this paper we propose a new approach for the econometric analysis of the dynamics of price discovery using a structural cointegration model for the price changes in arbitrage linked markets. Our methodology characterizes the dynamics of price discovery based on the impulse response functions from an identified structural cointegration model, and we measure the efficiency of a market’s price discovery by the absolute magnitude of cumulative pricing errors in the price discovery process. We apply our methodology to investigate the extent to which the US dollar contributes to the price discovery of the yen/euro exchange rate. Our results show that substantial price discovery of JPY/EUR occurs through the dollar, and that the efficiency of the dollar’s price discovery is positively related to the relative liquidity of the dollar markets versus the cross rate market.},

We show that a small" nominal friction in the goods market can make the response of output to monetary shocks large" and persistent if it is amplified by real wage rigidity in the labor market. We also argue that" given the level of real wage rigidity that is observed in developed countries nominal stickiness might be sufficient for money to produce economic fluctuations as persistent" as those observed in the data.},

author = {Kenneth R. French and Richard Roll},
abstract = {Asset prices are much more volatile during exchange trading hours than during non-trading hours. This paper considers three explanations for this phenomenon: (1) volatility is caused by public information which is more likely to arrive during normal business hours; (2) volatility is caused by private information which affects prices when informed investors trade; and (3) volatility is caused by pricing errors that occur during trading. Although a significant fraction of the daily variance is caused by mispricing, the behavior of returns around exchange holidays suggests that private information is the principle factor behind high trading-time variances.}

type = {Post-Print},
abstract = {We develop a dynamic model of a limit order market populated by strategic liquidity traders of varying impatience. In equilibrium, patient traders tend to submit limit orders, whereas impatient traders submit market orders. Two variables are the key determinants of the limit order book dynamics in equilibrium: the proportion of patient traders and the order arrival rate. We offer several testable implications for various market quality measures such as spread, trading frequency, market resiliency, and time to execution for limit orders. Finally, we show the effect of imposing a minimal price variation on these measures.},

an entity benefits from prior access to privileged market information
about upcoming transactions and trades. Front-running has been an is-
sue in financial instrument markets since the 1970s. With the advent of
the blockchain technology, front-running has resurfaced in new forms we
explore here, instigated by blockchain’s decentralized and transparent
nature. In this paper, we draw from a scattered body of knowledge and
instances of front-running across the top 25 most active decentral ap-
plications (DApps) deployed on Ethereum blockchain. Additionally, we
carry out a detailed analysis of Status.im initial coin offering (ICO) and
show evidence of abnormal miner’s behavior indicative of front-running
token purchases. Finally, we map the proposed solutions to front-running
into useful categories.},
