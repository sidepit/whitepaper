\section{Introduction}
Ever since bitcoin poeple have been trying to use the same techniques towards a decentralized exchange. Exchange has been well researched and developed in traditional centralized finaince for well over a century. [exchage cite] 

The word "central" is part of the common definitio of an exchange. "A central place where buying and sellers come to finf price and execute trades. 

The pupose of exchage is two fold. 1 - for price disoverry [cite]  2 - for counter party settlement 

Due to early bitcoin exchange hacks, Decentrlized Exchange or (DEX), has been mostly focused on the non-custodial side for the settlement utility. 

We focusing on the real public service of an Exchange, the price disovery utility. We design price discovery within a DEX, with a pupose of "Fair Price Discovery". 

With, Fair Price Disovery (FPD), as our goal. We focus on a mechanism designed exchange, for reaching equalibriam which produces price. 

Taking inspiratiuon from Rational Protocol Design analysis of Bitcoin, and looking back to the origional Bitcoin white-paper.
